Small datamart for the FIRN case study related to electric vehicles


### Main two datamarts

- Vehicle Pipeline
- Charging Station Pipeline

#### KPI's

- number of EV (specifically classified as plugin hybrids or full electric) # After the fact realized that EV = Electric Vehicle, so it's a double up in terms of naming, but it's a bit late to change now
- number of charging stations
- distance between two charging stations
- number of EV's by brand/model (for car side)
- distribution of charging stations (for charging station provider side)
